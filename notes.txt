Use this command to run the main function in sender.c:

make
./sender localhost 4562 4182 smallfile

Okay, this is really hard. 

What should I even do?

Okay, max size is 280.

That doesn't seem to help me much.

I will probably need 2 terminals. One for recieveing, the other for sending.

Okay, but let's break this down, shall we?

The goal is to have a bunch of packets, I send using the write() command.

I don't think there's data in a syn command?

No, there isn't.

Let's do this.

Make syn.

Recieve syn / ack.

Send data.

Next, read the data into the header, and get ready to send the file.
