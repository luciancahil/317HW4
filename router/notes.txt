Is the main command that gets run.

Maybe run router to start waiting for messages?

./tester tosend.script

Either that, or look through tutorials.

Well, the tutorials was useless.

Okay. I got it now. This is fine. 

Basically,

I'm gonna take a break.

come back to this later.



To Run:
Type "make"
type "./router
On another terminal, type "./tester tosend.script" (any other script is fine. Needs to be in this project).
When this is done, readpkt(fd, pkt, interface); in router.run will unfreeze.
The endless loop is fine.

int sendpkt(int fd, int interface, packet *pkt);


TODO:
Dummy send using interface 7.
Send after proper forwarding.
    Make a global variable. Figure out what. Something with pointers being dynamic arrays?
Send after verifying checksum.


Need to make a table_row structure.

What should the table row have?

It needs the address, the mask, and the port.

Should I have the masked address? Nah.

Anyways, make the struct.

Configure the table.

Check the incoming packets for dest.

(Later: Check the checksum).

Pass the packet to a function that returns the port.

Actually, I should probably read the packet first.


TODO Laters:

Check checksum

Decrement time to live (TTL)
